# terraform-azurerm-demo
This is a simple Terraform AzureRM provider demo.

To deploy this on Azure, you will need to have environment variables set for
ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_CLIENT_SECRET, ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, and ARM_TENANT_ID.
You will also need to have the ssh key file created on your local system.

Afterward, simply 'terraform init', 'terraform plan', and 'terraform apply'!
